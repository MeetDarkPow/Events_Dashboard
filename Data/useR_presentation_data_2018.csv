2018,14.00,Lightning talk,Tom Elliott,AUD,Historical data based priors for better bus arrival-time prediction,"models, data mining, applications, space/time, big data",Thomas Lin Pedersen,"We have been developing a real-time bus arrival-time prediction framework, which so far relies solely on real-time data. However, we believe we can improve predictions (especially long-range, 20+ minutes) by incorporating historical data into the priors. This is especially useful in locations with infrequent buses, or before and after peak hour when travel times increase and decrease, respectively. Using a years' worth of GPS location data from buses in Auckland, New Zealand, we explore various models to develop time-dependent priors for bus travel time.",NA,,,,
2018,14.05,Lightning talk,Jono Tuke,AUD,Pachinko prediction,"models, data mining",Thomas Lin Pedersen,"Social media is a great way for people to meet, chat and organise lunch, but it can also be used to meet, chat and organise protests. In this talk, I will explain how to use a Bayesian framework to predict social unrest from social media using Twitter as an example. So far so good, Bayesian modelling of Twitter data - but this is not that talk. How do you explain your modelling to the end-user? Not only that, but get them involved in the modelling?So let me show you how we used jam jars, coloured marbles, and the idea of Pachinko to explain our models to our collaborators, and how this started a conversation that lead to better models.",NA,,,,
2018,14.10,Lightning talk,Elvina Viennet,AUD,Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses: application to modelling the reproduction number of an infectious disease,"models, performance",Thomas Lin Pedersen,"The usefulness of any model depends on the accuracy and reliability of its output. Uncertainty (UA) and sensitivity analyses (SA) are two approaches integral to the modelling process. UA enables to describe the range of possible outputs that derives from uncertainty in inputs, while SA enables a description of how sensitive the outcome variables are to inputs variation. These analyses allow for the identification of which parameters are important in explaining the outcome variable.Let’s consider a model for epidemic potential of Zika virus in Australia. To build this model we included input parameters that dictate the dynamics of disease transmission, leading to an output variable that describes how likely an outbreak can occur at time (t). We undertook the simple steps of i) UA, using a latin hypercube sampling method to generate 100 000 samples of the epidemic potential, and of ii) SA using the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient analysis, to determine the statistical relationships between each input parameter and the epidemic potential while the other input parameters are kept constant.An overview of UA and SA in the context of infectious diseases modelling will be presented.",NA,,,,
2018,14.15,Lightning talk,Mark Wohlers,AUD,Deep Learning with Keras R to model Spectral Data,"algorithms, models",Thomas Lin Pedersen,"As deep learning has become more and more popular, TensorFlow has emerged as one of the dominant frameworks in the space. Keras, which runs on top of TensorFlow as well as other popular frameworks, is a high-level Python-based API with a user-friendly interface, large community, and clear documentation including an ever increasing number of examples. Recently the Keras R interface became available, making training deep learning models in R very accessible by connecting to this large resource. This R package also makes installing dependencies relatively straightforward, although some manual installations are still required.We give an overview of our experiences in learning to train deep learning models in R, starting with more basic examples before moving to applying on our own Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based dataset. This involved firstly training Convolutional Neural Networks, as suggested by Bjerrum et al. (2017) and then experimenting with other architectures such as LSTM networks.The implementation was carried out using Keras with the TensorFlow gpu backend while optimisation of the various hyperparameters used the RBayesianOptimization package.",NA,,,,
2018,14.20,Lightning talk,Saras Windecker,AUD,The zoon R package for reproducible and shareable species distribution modelling,"models, reproducibility, community/education",Thomas Lin Pedersen,"The rapid growth of species distribution modelling (SDM) as an ecological discipline has resulted in a large and diverse set of methods and software for constructing and evaluating SDMs. The disjointed nature of the current SDM research environment hinders evaluation of new methods, synthesis of current knowledge and the dissemination of new methods to SDM users. The zoon r package aims to overcome these problems by providing a modular framework for constructing reproducible SDM workflows. Zoon modules are interoperable snippets of r code, each carrying a SDM method that zoon combines into a single analysis object. Rather than defining these modules, zoon draws modules from an open, version-controlled online repository. zoon makes it easy for SDM researchers to contribute modules to this repository, enabling others to rapidly deploy new methods in their own workflows or to compare alternative methods. Each workflow object created by zoon is a rerunnable record of the data, code and results of an entire SDM analysis. This can then be easily shared, scrutinised, reproduced and extended by the whole SDM research community.",NA,,,,

2018,14.30,Lightning talk,Saskia Freytag,AUD,Can interactive shiny tools transform biological research?,"web app, bioinformatics, interfaces",Thomas Lin Pedersen,"The amount of biological data is increasing in excess of Moore’s law and the complexity of the data is astonishing. The number of Bioinformaticians, or people who specialize in the analysis of this type of data are insufficient, giving rise to lags in project progression leading to frustration for both bioinformatician and biologist. Interactive tools providing first pass exploratory analysis of novel datasets or dedicated statistical analysis of databases could create much needed relief and expedite analysis in general. Indeed, since the creation of the R package shiny many interactive Bioinformatics tools aimed at biologists have been created. For example, shinyGEO lets users explore and perform rudimentary analysis on all gene expression datasets stored in the public repository Gene Expression Omnibus. However, there are still many hurdles both in the creation and the uptake of such tools. As an author of two publicly available shiny tools, I want to share my experiences in building applications, designing their interfaces and their ultimate dissemination. I want to also touch on existing perceptions of such tools in both communities and how these might impede change",NA,,,,

2018,14.00,Lightning talk,Yan Holtz,AUD,Getting rich quick with R & Cryptocurrencies?,"applications, streaming data",Adrian Barnett,"Cryptocurrency has been a hot topic recently, with the Bitcoin price reaching 20k dollars in December 2017. I recently used R to recover the price of 5 cryptocurrencies for 2 months, on 5 platforms, at 10 second intervals. I then created a bot that automatically performed arbitrage: the simultaneous buying and selling of currency in different platforms in order to take advantage of differing prices.Both processes took advantage of the R potential for data visualization: the use of Dygraph (for interactive time series) and Flexdashboard (to create dashboard from R Markdown) enable the automatic generation of clean daily reports. The talk would first describe the technical process which allows the harvesting of data from both the public and private platform APIs. It would then describe how to visualize this information efficiently. It would also describe the price differences between platforms and will reveal whether arbitrage is a beneficial process for cryptocurrency.",NA,,,,
2018,14.05,Lightning talk,Ozan Cinar,AUD,poolR: Combining Dependent p-values,bioinformatics,Adrian Barnett,"Combining the p-values of a series of hypothesis tests is a task that is used in a variety of research fields. There are several well-known techniques for this purpose, such as Fisher’s and Stouffer’s methods. Furthermore, multiple testing methods, such as the Bonferroni correction can also be used for this purpose, by using the most significant corrected p-value from the set as the combined p-value. However, one important aspect of these methods (except for the Bonferroni correction) is that they assume independence among the tests and hence p-values to be combined. This assumption is known to be violated in some contexts. Therefore, the correlations among the p-values should be addressed appropriately. We present a new R package, poolR, that can be used for combining p-values. The package implements five methods for combining p-values. Furthermore, these methods can be modified in order to account for the dependence structure among the p-values. These modifications include adjustments based on the effective  number of tests and the use of empirically-derived null distributions. Moreover, generalizations of Fisher’s and Stouffer’s methods for dependent tests are also implemented.",NA,,,,
2018,14.10,Lightning talk,Tamal Kumar De,AUD,Handling Missing Data in Single-Case Experiments,"community/education, simulation, single-case, missing data",Adrian Barnett,"Single-case experiments have become increasingly popular in educational and behavioral research. However, analysis of single-case data is often complicated by missing or incomplete observations. This complication may lead to experiments no longer “meeting standards” set by, for example, the What Works Clearinghouse. Hence, it is important to determine optimal strategies for dealing with missing data.We conducted a simulation study in R to compare three randomization test strategies of handling missing data: (1) randomizing a missing data marker and calculating all reference statistics only for available data points; (2) estimating the missing data points by using minimum mean square error linear interpolation; and (3) multiple imputation methods based on resampling the available data points. We simulated datasets for phase designs, alternating treatments designs, and multiple baseline designs. Missingness was introduced in the simulated datasets by using multiple probabilities of data being “Missing Completely At Random”. The three strategies are compared in terms of Type I error rate and statistical power and are compared to the operating characteristics of the complete dataset.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_li4x9rH47tgWYA_4KyKZH6u5IPj9GcA,,,,
2018,14.15,Lightning talk,Dennis Wollersheim,AUD,What can you do with drugs?  Exploring Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme prescription drug usage using R,"visualisation, algorithms, models, databases, big data",Adrian Barnett,"In Australia, we have good prescription drug usage data, due to the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme, a population wide government insurance program. For example, the government recently released under creative commons license ten years of complete drug purchasing data for 10% of the population.  The data is also quite clean, having been processed through a government payment system, and therefore easy to use. R has a diverse, powerful and concise toolset, and is very useful to exploit this dataset.  It is a joy to be able to start with SQL queries on a postgres dataset,  pipe through various transformations, resulting in highly specific output forms, such as tables and graphs, maps and time series.  This workflow is replicable, archivable, expandable, and self documenting.   Remaining challenges mostly relate to dataset complexity, and domain specific problems, such as how to use the intermittent drug usage signal to isolate and characterise the different varieties of continuous drug usage, and more generally, how to make use of wide heterogeneity of medical information. This talk will demonstrate what we have figured out in this area.",NA,,,,
2018,14.20,Lightning talk,Laurent Thibault,AUD,npbr: A Package for Nonparametric Boundary Regression in R,nonparametric statistics,Adrian Barnett,"The package npbr is the first free specialized software for data edge and frontier analysis in the statistical literature. It provides a variety of functions for the best known and most innovative approaches to nonparametric boundary estimation. The selected methods are concerned with empirical, smoothed, unrestricted as well as constrained fits under both single and multiple shape constraints. They also cover data envelopment techniques as well as robust approaches to outliers. The routines included in npbr are user friendly and afford a large degree of  flexibility in the estimation specifications. They provide smoothing parameter selection for the modern local linear and polynomial spline methods as well asfor some promising extreme value techniques. Also, they seamlessly allow for Monte Carlo comparisons among the implemented estimation procedures. This package will be very useful for statisticians and applied researchers interested in employing nonparametric boundary regression models.

2018,14.30,Lightning talk,Pearse Alan Ryou,AUD,Exploiting the natural structure of a large spatial dataset to cut down on processing time: an example from the Great Barrier Reef,history,Adrian Barnett,"The mantra of “working smarter, not harder” is reminiscent of the bad advice you might have received from your high school careers counsellor.  However, when working with large spatial datasets, it pays to take the saying to heart. In this talk, I present the example of a geoprocessing problem I faced with data on the Great Barrier Reef. I had to delineate reef passages between all pairs of neighbouring reefs on the edge of the continental shelf, and find the average depth and slope of each of these passages. I present my methodology for exploiting the natural structure of the reef and the passages to drastically reduce the time required for each operation in R. Though the example is highly specialised, I hope it will help you to develop your own ideas for exploiting the natural spatial structure of otherwise prohibitively large datasets that you may be faced with.",https://www.dropbox.com/s/4n0jk217com58sq/Alan-R-Pearse-UseR_Lightning_Talk.pdf?dl=0,,,,

2018,14.40,Poster lightning,Mahmoud Ahmed,AUD,"pcr: an R package for quality assessment, analysis and testing of qPCR data","bioinformatics, data-access",Simon Jackson,"Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a broadly used technique in the biomedical research. We developed an R package to implement methods for quality assessment, analysis and testing qPCR data for statistical significance. The Double Delta CT and standard curve models were implemented to quantify the relative expression of target genes from CT values in standard qPCR. In addition, calculation of amplification efficiency and curves from serial dilution qPCR experiments are used to assess the data quality. Finally, two-group testing and linear models are used to test for statistical significance among conditions. Using two datasets from qPCR experiments, we applied different quality assessment, analysis and statistical testing in the pcr package and compared the results to the original published articles. The pcr package provides an intuitive and unified interface for its main functions to allow biologist to perform all necessary steps of qPCR analysis and produce graphs in a uniform way. ",NA,,,,

Carcinogenesis in these two types of cancers demonstrate similar multistep progression. The purpose of the study is to identify the significant consensus gene modules of these two cancers. We used a publicly available expression dataset for the study. The dataset included head neck cancer (42 cancer samples and 14 normal samples) and cervical cancer (20 cancer samples and 8 normal samples). We used only human papilloma virus 16 positive samples for excluding the bias according to the different types of HPV. We identified consensus modules of two types of cancers and explored the biological functions of each modules by annotation tool. We identified 8 consensus gene modules of head neck cancer and cervical cancer. Each module was well preserved between the two types of cancer.

2018,14.40,Poster lightning,Erika Siregar,AUD,AnalevR: An Interactive R-Based Analysis Environment for Utilizing BPS-Statistics Indonesia Data,"visualisation, web app, community/education, networks, big data, analysis, collaboration, cloud computing, analysis as a service, bps, statistics Indonesia, analysis environment, remote data analysis",Simon Jackson,"As Indonesia’s national statistical agency, BPS-Statistics Indonesia produces a massive amount of strategic data every year. However, these data are still underutilized by other parties (governments, researchers, etc.) due to technical limitations and raw data exclusivity and locality. Actually, numerous people outside BPS are capable of conducting analysis but unable to access the data. To increase the data usefulness, we introduce AnalevR, an online R-based analysis environment that allows anyone to perform analyses and create visualization without having to own the original raw data. It uses a notebook-like interface where users can type commands and the output appears below it. BPS provides the data and analysis service (including the R modules) which are held in cloud storage and can be explored via the helper function. Users remotely execute R commands and perform analysis inside the workspaces. A user can create up to 10 workspaces, each representing different sessions. Each saved session preserves the user-defined variables and functions for future use. This breakthrough will raise users’ involvement in employing BPS’ data and increase statistical quality in Indonesia. ",NA,,,,

2018,14.40,Poster lightning,Hannah Coughlan,AUD,Integration and visualisation of high throughput genomics data with R,"visualisation, bioinformatics",Simon Jackson,"As sequencing of DNA becomes a more affordable option for studying genomics research questions, more data types are becoming available. One interesting and complex data type, chromosome confirmation capture, aims to interrogate the 3D structure of chromosomes. The same 2 metres of DNA is compacted into the nucleus of every human cell regardless of the cell function, and the genes that determine the cell function are controlled by strict regulation. Chromosome structure can be a mechanism of gene regulation; more specifically, DNA loops form to spatially associate genes with regulators that are not adjacent in the linear genome.However, the techniques to study chromosome structure (Hi-C) are often limited by spatial resolution and can be difficult to interpret. Other genomics techniques that study gene expression (RNA-seq) and regulation (ChIP-seq) cannot discover far away regulators. Here we will show how different types of genomics data can be integrated to investigate long distance gene regulation. Using R and Bioconductor packages (edgeR, Sushi, GenomicRanges and limma) we can integrate data into a common framework that can be visualised to allow for biological interpretation.",NA,,,,

However when there are many time-series, the graph can become cluttered and thus difficult to read.  In order to portray the time-series data with many samples in a more intuitive way, a package for plotting an animated bubble chart was developed. A bubble chart here refers to the chart which represents one quantity but arranged in a way that the bubbles are packed close together to use the space efficiently. The quantity each bubble represents is proportional to the bubble area. There is already a package to plot a static bubble chart in R (Joe Chang et al., n.d.). The MovingBubbles package provides a method to add second and third information dimensions to the chart by means of animation and color. The animation portrays changes in data with time and also helps make the plot more engaging to the viewers.

This enables diversification of Ab portfolio and insures back up options if Ab candidate fails. However, there was no method or software available in-house to support Ab discovery with capacities to apply biophysical rules to classify the sequences. Shiny app ""Group My Abs"" was developed to apply biophysical properties for Ab characterization to the NGS data. Several Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithms implemented in the app enable sequence comparability. A method was developed to evaluate differences between comparable sequences and subsequently classify sequences into families. The app provides custom-made and interactive data visualization, enables refined Ab classification in a mathematical manner, considerably increases efficiency and insures reproducibility.

From competitive enforcement to merger control, the R language empowers our teams of economists in their work.We use R's flexibility and power to clean and model price and demand data when investigating anti-competitive agreements or mergers, and abuses of dominant position. R allows our analysts to rule out various theories of harm in the market, while re-focusing our efforts on specific areas of concern. We use several packages for data modeling, but dplyr and antitrust is particularly useful.When defining the geographic market in merger control, we use R's mapping and plotting packages ggmap, ggplot, leaflet and osrm.

This is an inefficient use of limited resources. The project involved developing RMarkdown reports and flexdashboards to visualise the variance in the processes being monitored.  CRAN packages such as qichart2 and the tidyverse were selected as useful tools for completing the project as well as consulting literature on Process Control and Lean methodology and contacting other R users in health systems such as the NHS in the UK.

2018,14.40,Poster lightning,Alan Pearse,AUD,SSNDesign -- An R Package for Optimal Designs on Spatial Stream Networks,"models, experimental design; optimal design; spatial stream networks",Simon Jackson,"Optimal experimental designs maximise the information gained from limited samples. Optimal designs are paramount when precise predictions or parameter estimates are required but data collection is resource intensive. R packages exist to find optimal designs for a few settings; e.g. AlgDesign and OPDOE. However, to our knowledge, there are no R packages for optimal design problems for stream and river networks. Stream networks provide a unique design challenge due to their branching structure and flow accumulation as water moves downstream. Given these statistical challenges and the importance of healthy freshwater ecosystems, computational tools for designing effective monitoring programs on streams with minimal cost for maximum impact are sorely needed. Here, we present SSNdesign; an R package for finding optimal designs on stream networks. This package relies on the S4 SpatialStreamNetwork object and models implemented in the package SSN. It has functionality for finding optimal designs for estimating model parameters and making predictions on stream networks.

Briefly, this approach allows to explore the underlying factorial structure of a theoretical construct, while simultaneously detecting unobserved subgroups in the study population. Thus, FMA becomes particularly useful to investigate psychological phenomena assumed to be categorical and continuous at the same time, and when the source of heterogeneity in the considered population may be not directly observed. Despite these advantages, its application within the psychological sciences remains limited. The current study aims to illustrate the utility of FMA within the context of attachment research in developmental psychology. By presenting a real data example concerning the latent structure of attachment in middle childhood, this work provides a practical example of FMA application using the FactMixtAnalyses package (Viroli, 2011). Furthermore, we will describe ad hoc R functions to assist in the interpretation of results. Benefits and drawbacks of applying FMA to this research area will be discussed.",NA,,,,

The amount of the shellfish production has been severely reduced due to the unexpected invasion of the ‘Japanese mud shrimp’ (Upogebia major) in some Korean tidal flats. Thus, it is highly required to know the habitat suitability for both organisms. In this study, the diverse simulations of the habitat classification were carried out using the available habitat data of the U. major and R. philippinarum. Supervised learning methods such as decision tree, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used with the three optimal clusters defined by R package ‘NbClust’. The decision trees were applied ‘bagging’ and ‘adaboost’ algorithms. Based on the simulation results, the prediction accuracies of each model in case of using the test data are estimated to be about 55-65%. This is considered to be due to outlier effects, and the overfitting problem due to the relatively small number of samples. In many biological data, these are still challenging problems.",NA,,,,

As you know, it is used to create loops. We think there is an inconvenience of 'for' loops in R. It is that the results you get will be gone away. So we have created a package to store the results automatically. To do it, you only need to cast one line spell 'magic_for.' For instance, to calculate squared values for 1 to 3 using 'for' loop and 'print' function is very easy. However, it becomes too much hassle to change such codes to store displayed results. You must prepare some containers with correct length for storing results and change 'print' function to assignment statements. Moreover, in such or more troublesome situations like where you have to store many variables, codes will grow more complex. The 'magicfor' package makes to resolve the problem with keep readability. You just add one line 'magic_for()' before 'for' loops. Once you call 'magic_for,' you can just execute 'for' as usual, the results will be stored in memory automatically. You can obtain the results using 'magic_result.' We introduce how to use the magic.",NA,,,,

Projects like Auto-WEKA or auto-sklearn aim to solve the Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization (CASH) problem resulting in a huge optimization space. However, for most real world applications, only few different learning algorithms are required to deliver superior performances. autoxgboost simplifies this idea one step further and the CASH problem to taking Gradient Boosting as a single learning algorithm in combination with intelligent model based hyperparameter tuning.

R packages exist to find optimal designs for a few settings; e.g. AlgDesign and OPDOE. However, to our knowledge, there are no R packages for optimal design problems for stream and river networks. Stream networks provide a unique design challenge due to their branching structure and flow accumulation as water moves downstream. Given these statistical challenges and the importance of healthy freshwater ecosystems, computational tools for designing effective monitoring programs on streams with minimal cost for maximum impact are sorely needed. Here, we present SSNdesign; an R package for finding optimal designs on stream networks. This package relies on the S4 SpatialStreamNetwork object and models implemented in the package SSN. It has functionality for finding optimal designs for estimating model parameters and making predictions on stream networks. Users can also define utility functions for their own design problems.",NA,,,,
2018,12.00,Poster,Tatiana Marci,Foyer,Using Factor Mixture Analysis in Developmental Psychology: An Application to Research on Parent-child Attachment,"applications, Factor Mixture Analysis, heterogeneous populations",NA,"Factor Mixture Analysis (FMA) is a useful tool to explore data from potentially heterogeneous populations using a crossbred of both categorical and continuous latent variables. Briefly, this approach allows to explore the underlying factorial structure of a theoretical construct, while simultaneously detecting unobserved subgroups in the study population. Thus, FMA becomes particularly useful to investigate psychological phenomena assumed to be categorical and continuous at the same time, and when the source of heterogeneity in the considered population may be not directly observed. Despite these advantages, its application within the psychological sciences remains limited. The current study aims to illustrate the utility of FMA within the context of attachment research in developmental psychology. By presenting a real data example concerning the latent structure of attachment in middle childhood, this work provides a practical example of FMA application using the FactMixtAnalyses package (Viroli, 2011). Furthermore, we will describe ad hoc R functions to assist in the interpretation of results. Benefits and drawbacks of applying FMA to this research area will be discussed. ",NA,,,,

The amount of the shellfish production has been severely reduced due to the unexpected invasion of the ‘Japanese mud shrimp’ (Upogebia major) in some Korean tidal flats. Thus, it is highly required to know the habitat suitability for both organisms. In this study, the diverse simulations of the habitat classification were carried out using the available habitat data of the U. major and R. philippinarum. Supervised learning methods such as decision tree, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used with the three optimal clusters defined by R package ‘NbClust’. The decision trees were applied ‘bagging’ and ‘adaboost’ algorithms. Based on the simulation results, the prediction accuracies of each model in case of using the test data are estimated to be about 55-65%. This is considered to be due to outlier effects, and the overfitting problem due to the relatively small number of samples. In many biological data, these are still challenging problems.",NA,,,,

As you know, it is used to create loops. We think there is an inconvenience of 'for' loops in R. It is that the results you get will be gone away. So we have created a package to store the results automatically. To do it, you only need to cast one line spell 'magic_for.' For instance, to calculate squared values for 1 to 3 using 'for' loop and 'print' function is very easy. However, it becomes too much hassle to change such codes to store displayed results. You must prepare some containers with correct length for storing results and change 'print' function to assignment statements. Moreover, in such or more troublesome situations like where you have to store many variables, codes will grow more complex. The 'magicfor' package makes to resolve the problem with keep readability. You just add one line 'magic_for()' before 'for' loops. Once you call 'magic_for,' you can just execute 'for' as usual, the results will be stored in memory automatically. You can obtain the results using 'magic_result.' We introduce how to use the magic.",NA,,,,

Instead, employees being not very familiar with data analysis are often called to do the job. Automatic machine learning can help those persons to perform predictive modeling with high performing machine learning tools without having much experience. This is achieved by making those applications parameter-free, i.e. only the data is required as input. Projects like Auto-WEKA or auto-sklearn aim to solve the Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization (CASH) problem resulting in a huge optimization space. However, for most real world applications, only few different learning algorithms are required to deliver superior performances. autoxgboost simplifies this idea one step further and the CASH problem to taking Gradient Boosting as a single learning algorithm in combination with intelligent model based hyperparameter tuning. It is based on the R-Packages mlr, mlrMBO and XGBoost. It also supports categorical variables due to special inbuilt factor feature encoding. Even though autoxgboost only uses one learner instead of a whole library, it provides comparable or even better performances. ",NA,,,,

In `oddstream` we define an anomaly as an observation that is very unlikely given the recent distribution of a given system. This package provides a framework that provides early detection of anomalous behaviour within a large collection of streaming time series.  This includes a novel approach that adapts to non-stationarity. In `stray` we define an anomaly as an observation that deviates markedly from the majority with a large distance gap.  This package provides a framework to detect anomalies in high dimensional data. Then the  framework is extended to identify anomalies in streaming temporal data.

Any R user can quickly and easily adopt workflowr, which includes four key features: (1) workflowr automatically creates a directory structure for organizing data, code, and results; (2) workflowr uses the version control system Git to track different versions of the code and results without the user needing to understand Git syntax; (3) to support reproducibility, workflowr automatically includes code version information in webpages displaying results and; (4) workflowr facilitates online Web hosting (e.g. GitHub Pages) to share results. Our goal is that workflowr will make it easier for scientists to organize and communicate reproducible research results.

Typically, these steps follow a familiar pattern of reading, cleaning, summarising, plotting and analysing data then producing a report. To aid reproducibility, naive examples using Rmarkdown are often presented. However, I  routinely employ a modular approach combining GNU Make, R, Rmarkdown and/or Sweave files tracked under git. This system helps to implement a don't repeat yourself (DRY) approach and scales up well as projects become more complex.To aid automation, I have developed generic R, Rmarkdown, STATA, SAS and other pattern rules for GNU Make as well as R packages to generate a project skeleton consisting of initial directories, Makefiles, R syntax files for basic data cleaning and summaries; move data files and documents to standard directories; use codebook information to specify factors and check data; and finally initialise and add these to a local git repository.

Writing those is no fun. Yet, when something goes wrong, unit tests are your best tool to quickly pinpoint errors. The genthat package can generate unit tests for you in the popular testthat format. Moreover, it can also be used to create reproductions when you find a bug in someone else’s code. There, instead of generating passing test cases it will generate the smallest, purposefully failing, one.Genthat does not magically create new tests out of the blue, instead it simply extracts the smallest possible test fragments from existing code. It does that by recording the input arguments and return values of all function called by clients of your package. The generated tests concentrate on single functions and test them independently of each other. Therefore a failing test usually locates the error more precisely that a failing chunk of application code. Trying it out on random set of 1500 CRAN packages, genthat managed to reproduce 80% of all function calls, increasing the unit test coverage from 19% to 54%.

This is challenging, especially in cities with limited resources, data, or analysis capabilities.  We briefly describe some technical details of our 'Active Transport Toolkit' (ATT), but the primary focus will be the context that led to the WHO contract and where we plan to go next.  We argue that useRs are well-placed to provide openly available, global-scale, transparent tools for policy making.

Since adoption, R has had significant uptake, and has been a great enabler for analysts.  R is more expressive and flexible than the existing tools, allowing them to more easily solve a variety of problems.  R is deployed on powerful servers, so users have a generous supply of memory and cores, meaning large datasets can be handled, and long-running computations parallelised.  Analysts access R using R Studio Server, and this IDE itself has had a number of positive impacts--the use of RStudio projects and R markdown documents in particular helps analysts work in a more organised way, and ensures work is reproducible.  Our statistical platforms can now also use R.  This is done via OpenCPU which enables remote exection of function via an HTTP API.

Several approaches have been explored for developing statistical methods that compare fixed (single) dose combinations to its component.  However, the extension of these approaches to a multiple dose combination clinical trial is not always so simple. Considering these facts we have proposed three approaches by which we can provide confirmatory assurance that combination of two or more drugs is more effective than the component drug alone. These approaches involved multiple comparisons in multilevel factorial design where the type 1 error is controlled by bonferroni test, bootstrap test, and a union intersection test where the least favorable null configuration has been considered. We have also built a R package implementing the above approaches and in this presentation we would like to  demonstrate how this R package can be used in a drug combination trial.

To prevent further declines, protected areas need to be established in places that will achieve conservation objectives for minimal cost. However, existing decision support tools tend to offer limited customizability and can take a long time to deliver solutions. To overcome these limitations and help prioritize conservation efforts in a transparent and reproducible manner, here we present the prioritizr R package. Inspired by the tidyverse principles, this R package provides a flexible interface for articulating, building and solving conservation planning problems. In contrast to existing tools, the prioritizr R package uses integer linear programming (ILP) techniques to mathematically formulate and solve conservation problems.

The statistical tools required to analyse the mass spectra struggle to keep pace with advancinginstrument capabilities and increasing quantities of data. Today most ultrahigh resolution analyses for complex mixture samples are based on single, labour-intensive, experiments.We present a new algorithm developed in R named Themis to jointly pre-process replicate measurements of a complex sample analysed using FTICR-MS. This improves consistency as a preliminary step to assigning chemical compositions, and the algorithm has a quality control criterion. Through the use of peak alignment and an adaptive mixture model-based strategy, it is possible to distinguish true peaks from noise.Themis demonstrated a more effective removal of noise-related peaks and the preservation and improvement of the chemical composition profile. Themis enabled the isolation of peaks that would have otherwise been discarded using traditional peak picking (based upon signal-to-noise ratio alone) for a single spectrum.",NA,,,,

Second, it doesn't use subjective ratings, which can be unreliable given the pervasive influence of social media: a product that gets review-bombed after going viral will have meaningless ratings. Third, it takes event times into account, thus allowing recommendations to evolve with changing trends. Finally, it does well in recommending cold items, by building a regression model on item data.

In an scRNAseq analysis individual cells are typically clustered to group them by cell type. After clustering, identifying what type of cell is in each cluster (e.g. neurons) usually needs domain-specific knowledge of marker genes and function. The celaref package accepts pre-computed cell-clusters and aims to suggest cell-types for each cluster via similarity to reference datasets (scRNAseq experiments or microarrays) from similar samples. Briefly, within-dataset differential expression is calculated to identify the most enriched genes for each cluster, then their rankings are examined in reference datasets. Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests are used to decide if multiple matches should be reported. Initial experiments on brain, lacrimal gland and blood PBMC samples show sensible matching between similar cell types without overreaching on dissimilar cells.

Survival data refers to a variable corresponding to the time from a defined baseline until occurrence of an event of interest. Depending on the field, the analysis of survival data can be known as survival, duration, reliability, or event history analysis. It has been common to make simplifying parametric assumptions when simulating survival data, e.g. assuming survival times follow an exponential or Weibull distribution. However, such assumptions are unrealistic in many settings. The simsurv package provides additional flexibility by allowing users to simulate survival times from 2-component mixture distributions or a user-defined hazard function. The mixture distributions allow for a variety of flexible baseline hazard functions. Moreover, a user-defined hazard function can provide even greater flexibility since the cumulative hazard does not require a closed-form solution.

We thus propose to enhance mclapply with a new parameter that allows mapping tasks to specific CPUs. The new affinity.list parameter, already available on the R-devel branch, allows setting a so-called CPU affinity mask that specifies on which CPU a given task is allowed to run. We demonstrate the benefits of the new mclapply version by showing how it can speed up parallel applications like parameter tuning.

The ability of R to cater to users who do not see themselves as programmers, but then allow them to slide gradually into programming, is an enduring quality of the language and is what has allowed it to gain significance over time. As the R community has grown in size and diversity, R’s ability to match the needs of the community has similarly grown. However, this growth has raised interesting questions about R’s value proposition today and how new users to R should be introduced to the system.

The user specifies an objective and set of constraints by combining constants, variables, and parameters using a library of functions with known mathematical properties. CVXR then applies signed disciplined convex programming (DCP) to verify the problem's convexity. Once verified, the problem is converted into standard conic form using graph implementations and passed to a cone solver such as ECOS or SCS.

When the stopping criterium is|w_{k+1}-w_k|<? we have that GD requires O(log(1/ ?)) iteration while SGD needs O(1/ ?).Albeit the iterative nature of the SGD prevents its straightforward parallelization, a few alternatives have been proposed in the literature for carrying out its parallel implementation.

The function, the first and second derivatives are provided by the majority of industrial codes. We propose a robust optimization procedure that leans on the prediction function and its derivatives. Those predictions are given by the kriging. The use of the derivatives improves the metamodel quality. We rely on Rccp and nloptr packages of R to estimate, predict and simulate the kriging with derivatives. Taylor theorem that is calculated with the prediction of the function and its derivatives is applied on each used point to approximate the variation of the function. This cheap criterion is used as the replacement of a full computation of the second moment from the model. A Pareto front of robust solutions (minimization of the function and the robustness criterion) is then generated by the NSGA-II genetic algorithm through the nsga2r package from R.

Instead, these arrays may be stored on-disk, using the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5), for example. The Bioconductor project has developed the DelayedArray, which supports different 'backends' to wrap around an in-memory, on-disk, or remotely served representation of an array, providing a unified interface to the data that is familiar to users of ordinary R arrays. In this sense, a DelayedArray is to an array as a tibble is to a data frame.

However, due to the complex estimation of these models using simulated maximum likelihood (SML) is quite difficult to compare or even replicate results from different software implementations, even using the same database. For example, the estimates depend on the optimization algorithm, the way on how random numbers are generated; the prime number used if Halton draws are selected, etc. Despite the now widespread use of these methods and these consideration, there appears to be no systematic investigation of the accuracy of these models or a comparison of the performance of the SML estimation routines that now exist in several software.

When disease prevalence is small, the majority of these groups will test negatively. For positive testing groups, there are many algorithmic retesting procedures available to differentiate positive individuals from negative ones. The appeal of group testing to laboratories is that the number of tests needed is significantly less than testing each individual separately. Both estimating the probability of disease infection and identifying positive/negative individuals are goals of group testing. Unfortunately, no package has been available to address the identification goal for the most common group testing algorithms. We present the first functions for identification and make these available in the binGroup package to complement its large set of estimation functions.

For researchers investigating the scholarly literature the full text archive of JSTOR (http://www.jstor.org) offers a rich and diverse set of journal articles and other texts. Through its service Data for Research (http://www.jstor.org/dfr/), JSTOR gives researchers the opportunity to analyse this data, by delivering metadata, n-grams and, upon special request, full-text materials. jstor (https://tklebel.github.io/jstor/) enables researchers to easily import the supplied metadata to R. These metadata can either be analysed on their own, or be used in conjunction with n-grams or full-text-data. The presentation will show how jstor supports investigations of scholarly literature, covering the analysis of n-grams and citation analysis. Besides introducing possible applications, the paper will also discuss limitations regarding data quality and possible solutions thereof.",NA,,,,
2018,10.30,New dev for temporal data,Earo Wang,AUD,tsibble: The 15th time series standard,"visualisation, space/time",Natalia da Silva,"The conventional matrix structure that underlies time series models in R does not easily accommodate a few complications, such as multiple variables, heterogeneous data types, low time resolutions, implicit missing values, and multilevel. This work addresses the broader issues of better data structures and modern data pipelines for analysing and visualising temporal-context data. We extend the tidy data concept to temporal data, and note that the “molten” data structure is flexible enough to handle heterogeneity, low time resolutions, and implicit missing values. There are two constraints required to turn the “molten” data into a valid temporal data: (1) an explicitly declared index variable containing timestamps; (2) a constraint uniquely identifies the multiple units of measurements, which is referred to as a “key”. A syntactical approach is introduced to describe nested or crossed data structure, which employs the “key”. Based on the tidy temporal data, a data pipeline is discussed and formulated to facilitate time-based transformation and visualisation. A case study is included to demonstrate the tidy structure and the data pipeline ideas and usage.",NA,,,,

2018,11.10,New dev for temporal data,Mitchell O'Hara-Wild,AUD,fasster: Forecasting multiple seasonality with state switching,"algorithms, models, streaming data, timeseries",Natalia da Silva,"Forecasting time-series which contain multiple seasonal patterns requires flexible modelling approaches, and the need for continuously updating models emphasises the importance of fast model estimation. In response to shortcomings in current models, a new model is proposed which brings the desirable qualities of speed, flexibility and support for exogenous regressors into a state space model. This proposed model also introduces state switching, which captures groups of irregular multiple seasonality by switching between states. The functionality of the proposed model extends beyond forecasting, by allowing for model based time-series decomposition, imputation of missing values, and support for streaming data.This model is available as an R package (mitchelloharawild/fasster), which provides formula based model specification, and uses tidy data structures (tsibble) and APIs which will later become familiar in forecast's next iteration: tidyforecast.",NA,,,,
2018,11.30,New dev for temporal data,Thiyanga Talagala,AUD,seer: R package for feature-based forecast-model selection,"algorithms, models, time series",Natalia da Silva,"The seer package provides a novel framework for forecast model selection using time series features. We call this framework FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model Selection). The underlying approach involves computing a vector of features from the time series which are then used to select the forecasting model. The model selection process is carried out using a classification algorithm -- we use the time series features as inputs, and the best forecasting algorithm as the output. The classification algorithm can be built in advance of the forecasting exercise (so it is an “offline” procedure). Then, when we have a new time series to forecast, we can quickly compute its features, use the pre-trained classification algorithm to identify the best forecasting model, and produce the required forecasts. Thus, the “online” part of our algorithm requires only feature computation, and the application of a single forecasting model, with no need to estimate large numbers of models within a class, or to carry out a computationally-intensive cross-validation procedure. This framework is compared against several benchmarks and other commonly used forecasting methods.",NA,,,,

In the social sciences it has been extremely popular with researchers at the more quantitative end of the spectrum - but uptake has been less widespread outside of the more statistically inclined. I don't think the R language needs to be limited in this way. Since 2011 I've been teaching introductory research methods classes for undergraduates using R, running programming classes for R with postgraduate students, doing my own data analysis with R, implementing cognitive models with R and occasionally even running behavioural experiments in R.

This is based on an open data set provided by the UK Government on the MOT, an annual car check mandatory for all vehicles older than three years. We hope that the results of this can inform customer choice when purchasing used (or new) vehicles as well as provide some interesting results. In particular, we consider geographical, vehicle, owner data, and interactions between these groups to identify the main drivers for a car to fail an MOT. We also consider the severity of a fail, eg. a non-working number plate light versus unsafe brake discs. We use these results to inform the training and design of a model that we train to predict failure (or passing) of a given vehicle. Additionally, we present results that were found using some less-common techniques. We also consider whether there are significant regional differences in pass or fail rates for different car brands or models.",NA,,,,

Digital disease surveillance tools such as ProMed, HealthMap etc. have the potential to serve as important early warning systems as well as complement the field surveillance data during an ongoing outbreak. While there are a number of systems that carry out digital disease surveillance, there is as yet a lack of tools that can compile and analyse the generated data to produce easily understood actionable reports. I will present a flexible statistical model that uses different streams of data (such as disease surveillance data, mobility data etc.) for short-term incidence trend forecasting. I will also highlight an example of disaggregating aggregated data to obtain incidence information at a fine spatial scale. This could be particularly important in instances where information at sub-national levels is lacking or incomplete.

When the table is big, it is extremely hard to discovery pattern by examining the cell frequencies. Doubly classified models are a set of statistical models aim to reveal patterns out from a cross classification table. There are substantial applications of these models. For instance, social researchers who are interested to find out intergenerational social mobility will find this way of analysing refreshing. These models are not new-fangled, but standard textbooks cover only a few of them, and journal articles are usually too technical to grasp the idea behind the model. For those with little mathematical statistic background, it causes great difficult to understand them. The talk focuses on conveying these models using a new graphical table tool called symbolic tables to give the basic idea about the models. Together, using a few standard R functions, mainly generalized linear model, doubly classified models can be set up easily. Real life examples will be illustrated, extracted mainly from the book titled “Doubly Classified Model with R”, written by the author.",NA,,,,

Howeverwhen modelling real data, tools for assessing such regularityconditions are yet to be developed.

The main hindrance to their wider use in practice seems to be the inability to directly model the mean of counts, making them not compatible with nor comparable to competing count regression models, such as the log-linear Poisson, negative binomial or generalized Poisson regression models. In this talk, we will review how CMP can be parametrized via the mean, so that simpler and more easily-interpretable mean-models can be used, such as a log-linear model. A newly developed R package to fit the model to data will be discussed. Some simulated and real datasets will be used as demonstration.",NA,,,,

R code is handled automatically, but C code must protect from the GC the R values it needs and unprotect them after. Forgetting to protect and/or to unprotect (protect bug) often makes R crash but also can lead to incorrect results. It is not uncommon that old protect bugs are uncovered much later by inconsequential code changes. These bugs are common and hard to find, and thus R offers tools to detect them. `gctorture` helps testing by increasing the chance a protect bug will crash R and will do so sooner after the code with the bug executes. `rchk` is a static analysis tool that identifies potential protect bugs in C code without executing it; it is used regularly to check incoming CRAN packages. Finally, protect bugs can be prevented by following several simple programming rules. The talk is intended for package developers and everyone who write C code to work with R.",NA,,,,
